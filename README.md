**# GDSC Recruitment Task**

This project is the recruitment task for the Google Developer Student Clubs at Shiv Nadar University. The task involves styling a basic instructions page to create a functional and user-friendly website.

What This Project Includes:

_**Page Styling:**_

The initial page is a basic template that needs to be styled and improved. I used CSS to enhance the design, layout, and user experience.

_**Submission System:**_

I implemented the submission system using HTML and Javascript. Javascript saved, loaded, and displayed the submissions. Using Javascript eliminated the need for a database management system, which simplified the project. The submissions can easily be viewed by clicking the "View Submissions" button.

_**Going Live:**_

I used Netlify to deploy my website. This is the link to the deployed page: https://gdsc-task-sj993.netlify.app/ 

_**Using the Page:**_

Navigation: The two angular brackets(GDSC logo) below the slides are buttons for next and previous slide. To the top right corner is the "View Submissions" Button which takes you to the Submissions List. On the top right corner of the Submissions page is the "Back to Task" Button which will take you back to the main page.

Submission: To submit the link to your GitHub Repository, type or paste the link in the input field below the slide and click the "Submit" Button. If you click the button without entering anything, it will give you a warning to enter a link before submitting, otherwise it will say "Submitted". If you go to the Submissions Page you will find the link you entered. 

Clearing the Submissions: You can click the blue "Clear" Button on the Submissions Page to erase the links in the list.
