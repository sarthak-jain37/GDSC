# GDSC Recruitment Task

This project is the recruitment task for the Google Developer Student Clubs at Shiv Nadar University. The task involves styling a basic instructions page to create a functional and user-friendly website.

What This Project Includes:

**Page Styling:**__

The initial page is a basic template that needs to be styled and improved. I used CSS to enhance the design, layout, and user experience.

_**Submission System:**_

I implemented the submission system using HTML and Javascript. Javascript saved, loaded, and displayed the submissions. Using Javascript eliminated the need for a database management system, which simplified the project. The submissions can easily be viewed by clicking the "View Submissions" button.

_**Going Live:**_
I used Netlify to deploy my website. This is the link to the deployed page: https://gdsc-task-sj993.netlify.app/
